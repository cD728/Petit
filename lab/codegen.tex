% the first exercise should be a manual LLVM IR implementation

We shall consider only type double for all of the following exercises.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement code generation for multiplication.
\item Implement code generation for the other three arithmetic operations.
\item Implement code generation for using double variables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Allocate a stack space for each variable.
\item Modify the code so that assignments to double variables are allowed.
\item Implement the case of identifiers used in expressions.
\end{enumerate}
\item According to the language semantics, it is possible to assign integer values to double variables and \textit{vice versa}. In both cases it is necessary to make the appropriate conversion. Natural constants must be converted to double before assigning their value to a variable of double type; and Decimal constants must be converted to integer before assigning their value to an integer variable. Implement these two cases.
\end{enumerate}
