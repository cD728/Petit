We shall consider only type double for all of the following exercises.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement code generation for multiplication.
\item Implement code generation for the other three arithmetic operations.
\item Implement code generation for using double variables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Allocate a stack space for each variable.
\item Modify the code so that assignments to double variables are allowed.
\item Implement the case of identifiers used in expressions.
\end{enumerate}
\item According to the language semantics, it is possible to assign an integer value to a double (but not the other way around). Implement code generation to convert Natural constants to double before assigning their value to a double variable.
\end{enumerate}
